terminator

OVERVIEW:

Terminator runs a command as though it were on a terminal using a PTY. This is
useful to trick programs into diabling buffering, or otherwise acting as if
they are interactive, while still capturing their output.

Currently, standard input is not redirected through the PTY. This means that if
terminator's standard input is redirected to a pipe, the inner command will
also see its input redirected to a pipe. This is probably fine, because
standard output will still appear to be a terminal.

COMPILING:

To compile terminator, simply run the given makefile.

RUNNING:

    terminator command [arg...]

To run terminator, give the command to run and all its command line arguments
as arguments to terminator. Terminator uses the execvp system call to run the
command, so the path will be searched if the command name is not a path.
